## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) Python MultiCore Framework
PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. This is a Python port of the [AS3 reference implementation of the MultiCore Version](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-multicore-framework/wiki). It supports [modular programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) through the use of [Multiton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton) Core actors instead of the [Singleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)s used in the [Standard Version](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-python-standard-framework/wiki).

The unit tests are included in this repository.
