    A base Multiton `IFacade` implementation.

    In PureMVC, the `Facade` class assumes these responsibilities:

    Initializing the `Model`, `View` and `Controller` Singletons.

    Providing all the methods defined by the `IModel, IView, & IController` interfaces.

    Providing the ability to override the specific `Model`, `View` and `Controller` Singletons created.

    Providing a single point of contact to the application for registering `Commands` and notifying `Observers`
