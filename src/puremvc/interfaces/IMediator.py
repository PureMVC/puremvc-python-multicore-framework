class IMediator(INotifier):
    """
    The base interface for all Mediator classes.

    In PureMVC, `IMediator` implementors assume these responsibilities:

    Implement a common method which returns a list of all `INotification`
    the `IMediator` has interest in implementing a notification callback method.
    Implement methods that are called when the IMediator is registered or removed from the View.
    
    Additionally, `IMediator` typically:

    Act as an intermediary between one or more view components such as text boxes or
    list controls, maintaining references and coordinating their behavior.

    In Flash-based apps, this is often the place where event listeners are
    added to view components, and their handlers implemented.

    Respond to and generate `INotifications`, interacting with of
    the rest of the PureMVC app.

    When an `IMediator` is registered with the `IView`,
    the `IView` will call the `IMediator`'s
    `list_notification_interests` method. The `IMediator` will
    return an `Array` of `INotification` names which
    it wishes to be notified about.

    The `IView` will then create an `Observer` object
    encapsulating that `IMediator`'s (`handle_notification`) method
    and register it as an Observer for each `INotification` name returned by
    `list_notification_interests`.
