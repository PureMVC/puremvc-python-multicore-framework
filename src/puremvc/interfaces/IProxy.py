    The interface definition for a PureMVC Proxy.

    In PureMVC, 'IProxy' implementors assume these responsibilities:</P>

    Implement a common method which returns the name of the Proxy.
    Provide methods for setting and getting the data object.

    Additionally, 'IProxy's typically:

    Maintain references to one or more pieces of model data.
    Provide methods for manipulating that data.
    Generate 'INotifications' when their model data changes.
    Expose their name as a 'public static const' called 'NAME',
    if they are not instantiated multiple times.
    Encapsulate interaction with local or remote services used to fetch and persist model data.
