    In PureMVC, the `View` class assumes these responsibilities:

    Maintain a cache of `IMediator` instances.
    Provide methods for registering, retrieving, and removing `IMediators`.
    Managing the observer lists for each `INotification` in the application.
    Providing a method for attaching `IObservers` to an `INotification`'s observer list.
    Providing a method for broadcasting an `INotification`.
    Notifying the `IObservers` of a given `INotification` when it broadcast.
