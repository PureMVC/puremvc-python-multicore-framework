class IController(ABC):
    """
    The interface definition for a PureMVC Controller.

    In PureMVC, an `IController` implementor follows the 'Command and Controller' strategy, and
    assumes these responsibilities:

    Remembering which `ICommand`s are intended to handle which `INotifications`.

    Registering itself as an `IObserver` with the `View` for each `INotification`
    that it has an `ICommand` mapping for.

    Creating a new instance of the proper `ICommand` to handle a given `INotification` when notified by the `View`.

    Calling the `ICommand`'s `execute` method, passing in the `INotification`.
