class INotifier(ABC):
    """
    The interface definition for a PureMVC Notifier.

    `MacroCommand, Command, Mediator` and `Proxy`
    all have a need to send `Notifications`.

    The `INotifier` interface provides a common method called
    `send_notification` that relieves implementation code of
    the necessity to actually construct `Notifications`.

    The `Notifier` class, which all the above-mentioned classes
    extend, also provides an initialized reference to the `Facade`
    Singleton, which is required for the convenience method
    for sending `Notifications`, but also eases implementation as these
    classes have frequent `Facade` interactions and usually require
    access to the facade anyway.
