class INotification(ABC):
    """
    The interface definition for a PureMVC Notification.

    PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such
    as the one provided with Flash, and ActionScript 3 does
    not have an inherent event model.

    The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists
    to support event-driven communication between the
    application and the actors of the MVC triad.

    Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for Events
    in Flex/Flash/AIR. Generally, `IMediator` implementors
    place event listeners on their view components, which they
    then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the broadcast of `Notification` to
    trigger `ICommand` or to communicate with other `IMediator`, `IProxy` and `ICommand`
    instances communicate with each other and `IMediator` by broadcasting `INotification`.

    A key difference between Flash `Event` and PureMVC
    `Notification` is that `Event` follows the
    'Chain of Responsibility' pattern, 'bubbling' up the display hierarchy
    until some parent component handles the `Event`, while
    PureMVC `Notification` follows a 'Publish/Subscribe'
    pattern. PureMVC classes need not be related to each other in a
    parent/child relationship to communicate with one another
    using `Notification`.
